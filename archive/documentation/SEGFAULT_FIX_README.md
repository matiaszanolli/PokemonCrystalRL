# Segmentation Fault Fix for Pokemon Crystal RL

## üö® Problem Description

The Pokemon Crystal RL trainer was experiencing segmentation faults when running with screen capture enabled, particularly on systems with NVIDIA GPUs. The crash occurred in the NVIDIA OpenGL driver when PyBoy attempted to update SDL2 textures.

### Stack Trace Analysis
```
Thread 1 "python" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fff95246548 in ?? () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-glcore.so.570.169

#9  0x00007fffa328ab5a in GL_UpdateTexture () from .../libSDL2-2.0.so
```

## ‚úÖ Root Cause

The issue occurs when:
1. PyBoy initializes SDL2 in headless mode (`window="null"`)
2. SDL2 attempts to use hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering
3. NVIDIA drivers have conflicts with the specific OpenGL context creation
4. The crash happens during texture updates in the screen capture system

## üîß Solutions

### Solution 1: Automatic SDL Driver Fix (Recommended)

Run the automatic fix script:

```bash
python fix_sdl_driver.py
```

This script will:
- Detect your GPU setup
- Test different SDL drivers
- Apply the best working configuration
- Set up environment variables

### Solution 2: Manual SDL Driver Configuration

Set the SDL video driver to avoid hardware acceleration conflicts:

```bash
# For current session
export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy

# For permanent fix
echo 'export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Solution 3: Disable Screen Capture (Temporary)

If you only need basic training without monitoring:

```bash
python run_pokemon_trainer.py --rom ../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc --mode fast_monitored --no-capture
```

## üß™ Verification

Test that the fix works:

```bash
# Test with the fix script
python fix_sdl_driver.py --test

# Test the full trainer
python run_pokemon_trainer.py --rom ../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc --mode fast_monitored --episodes 1 --actions 30 --web
```

## üìä Performance Impact

| Configuration | Status | Screen Capture | Web UI | Performance |
|---------------|---------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Default (broken) | ‚ùå Segfaults | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | N/A |
| SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ~2.4 actions/sec |
| --no-capture | ‚úÖ Works | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ~50 actions/sec |
| --mode ultra_fast --no-llm | ‚úÖ Works | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ~600 actions/sec |

## üîç Technical Details

### Why This Happens

1. **NVIDIA Driver Interaction**: The specific NVIDIA driver version (570.169) has issues with certain OpenGL context configurations
2. **SDL2 + PyBoy**: PyBoy uses SDL2 for rendering, which tries to create OpenGL contexts even in headless mode
3. **Texture Updates**: The crash occurs specifically during `SDL_UpdateTexture` calls when screen capture is active

### Why the Fix Works

- **SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy**: Forces SDL2 to use a software-only driver that doesn't interact with GPU drivers
- **No Performance Loss**: For headless training, GPU acceleration isn't needed anyway
- **Full Compatibility**: Maintains all features (screen capture, web UI, OCR) without crashes

## üöÄ Usage After Fix

Once the fix is applied, all training modes work normally:

```bash
# Fast monitored training with web interface
python run_pokemon_trainer.py --rom ../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc --mode fast_monitored --episodes 5 --web

# Ultra-fast training
python run_pokemon_trainer.py --rom ../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc --mode ultra_fast --actions 5000 --no-llm

# Curriculum learning
python run_pokemon_trainer.py --rom ../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc --mode curriculum --episodes 20
```

## üõ† System Requirements

### Confirmed Working On:
- Ubuntu 25.04 with NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti
- NVIDIA Driver 570.169
- PyBoy 2.6.0
- SDL2 2.32.0 (via pysdl2-dll)

### Likely Works On:
- Any Linux system with NVIDIA GPUs
- Systems with similar OpenGL driver conflicts
- WSL2 environments with GPU passthrough

## üìù Additional Notes

### Memory Management
There's also a minor memory corruption issue during cleanup (unrelated to the main segfault):
```
free(): invalid pointer
double free or corruption (!prev)
```

This occurs after training completes and doesn't affect functionality. It will be addressed in a future update to PyBoy cleanup procedures.

### Alternative Approaches Tested
- ‚ùå `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=software` - Not available on most systems
- ‚ùå `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` - Still triggers NVIDIA driver issues  
- ‚ùå `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` - Similar GPU driver conflicts
- ‚úÖ `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` - Clean, no driver interaction

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Run `python fix_sdl_driver.py` to apply the automatic fix
2. Test your training setup
3. Enjoy stable Pokemon Crystal RL training!

The fix is transparent - all functionality remains the same, just without the crashes.
