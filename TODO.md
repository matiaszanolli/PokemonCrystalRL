TODO LIST RECOMMENDED: When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete. Benefits of creating a todo list now: Clear roadmap for implementation Progress tracking throughout the task Nothing gets forgotten or missed Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan Example structure: - [ ] Analyze requirements - [ ] Set up necessary files - [ ] Implement main functionality - [ ] Handle edge cases - [ ] Test the implementation - [ ] Verify results Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
