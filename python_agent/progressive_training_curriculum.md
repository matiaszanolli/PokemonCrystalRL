## Implementation Strategy

### Progressive Knowledge Transfer
```python
class CurriculumTrainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_stage = 1
        self.stage_competency = {}
        self.knowledge_base = SemanticDatabase()
    
    def advance_stage(self):
        if self.validate_current_stage():
            self.transfer_knowledge()
            self.current_stage += 1
    
    def transfer_knowledge(self):
        # Transfer successful strategies to next stage
        previous_strategies = self.get_stage_strategies(self.current_stage)
        self.knowledge_base.promote_strategies(previous_strategies)
```

### Adaptive Curriculum
- **Fast Learners**: Accelerated progression with combined stages
- **Struggling Areas**: Extended practice in specific stages
- **Regression Handling**: Return to previous stages if performance drops

### Success Metrics
- **Stage Completion Rate**: % of validation criteria met
- **Knowledge Retention**: Performance on previous stage skills
- **Transfer Efficiency**: How quickly new skills build on old ones
- **Overall Progress**: Movement toward game completion

### Training Data Collection
- **Success Patterns**: Store winning strategies by stage
- **Failure Analysis**: Catalog and avoid repeated mistakes
- **Context Recognition**: Build situation-appropriate response library
- **Performance Analytics**: Track learning curve and optimization opportunities
