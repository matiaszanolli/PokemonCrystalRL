- **Game state monitoring** with live statistics tracking
- **Action history tracking** with reasoning and timestamps
- **Agent decision logging** with confidence scores and visual context
- **Performance metrics collection** for training analysis
- **REST API endpoints** for historical data access
- **Multi-threaded architecture** for non-blocking operation

### 2. Enhanced Training Integration (`web_enhanced_training.py`)
- **Seamless integration** with existing training sessions
- **Training hooks** to capture data without modifying core training logic  
- **Interactive mode** with automatic web server startup
- **Graceful shutdown handling** with signal processing
- **Command-line interface** with flexible configuration options

### 3. Modern Web Dashboard (`templates/dashboard.html`)
- **Responsive design** with professional dark theme
- **Live game screen display** with pixelated Game Boy aesthetic
- **Real-time statistics panels** for player, party, and training data
- **Action and decision logs** with scrolling history
- **WebSocket client** for real-time updates without page refresh
- **Control interface** for starting/stopping monitoring
- **Performance optimized** with automatic cleanup and memory management

### 4. Testing and Verification (`test_web_monitor.py`)
- **Mock data generator** for testing without ROM requirements
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all dashboard features

```bash
python test_web_monitor.py
# Opens http://127.0.0.1:5000 with mock Pokemon data
```

### Full Training with Web Monitoring
```bash  
python web_enhanced_training.py --rom pokecrystal.gbc --episodes 50
# Starts training with live web dashboard
```

### Web-Only Mode (Monitor Existing Data)
```bash
python web_enhanced_training.py --web-only --port 5000
# Serves dashboard for existing training data
```
