# Progressive Curriculum Training Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the progressive curriculum training system for Pokemon Crystal RL. Instead of random exploration, this system teaches the LLM agent Pokemon Crystal through a structured 10-stage curriculum that builds skills progressively.

## üéØ Key Advantages

### Traditional RL Training Problems:
- **Random exploration** leads to inefficient learning
- **No structure** - agent learns bad habits early
- **Poor knowledge transfer** between different game phases
- **Inconsistent performance** across game mechanics
- **Long training times** with unclear progress

### Curriculum Training Solutions:
- **Progressive skill building** from basic to advanced
- **Mastery validation** ensures competency before advancement
- **Knowledge transfer** - skills build upon each other
- **Structured learning** with clear objectives
- **Measurable progress** with detailed analytics

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration
```python
trainer = CurriculumTrainer(
    rom_path="../roms/pokemon_crystal.gbc",  # Required: Pokemon Crystal ROM
    save_state_path=None,                    # Optional: Starting save state
    semantic_db_path="curriculum.db"         # Database for training progress
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Customizable validation criteria
stage_validation = StageValidation(
    success_rate_threshold=0.8,  # Required success rate (80%)
    min_episodes=10,             # Minimum episodes before advancement
    max_episodes=25,             # Maximum episodes before timeout
    validation_tasks=[...],      # Specific tasks to validate
    performance_metrics={...}    # Required performance thresholds
)
```

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Real-time Monitoring
The system tracks comprehensive metrics for each stage:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful episodes
- **Performance Metrics**: Stage-specific measurements
- **Learning Curve**: Progress over time
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Skill retention across stages

### Example Output:
```
üìñ Training Stage 4: BATTLE_FUNDAMENTALS
üìä Stage 4 Progress - Episode 15
   Success Rate: 75.0%
   Avg Performance: 0.782
   Episodes Completed: 20

‚úÖ Stage 4 MASTERED!
   üìä Success Rate: 84%
   üìà Avg Performance: 0.856
   üéØ Episodes: 28
```

## üíæ Data Storage

### Training Databases
The system creates several databases to track progress:

- **curriculum_validation.db**: Stage validation results
- **curriculum_semantic.db**: Semantic knowledge and successful strategies
- **curriculum_training_[timestamp].db**: Session-specific training data

### Knowledge Transfer
Successful strategies from earlier stages are:
- Stored in semantic databases
- Transferred to later stages
- Used to improve decision-making
- Built into cumulative knowledge base

---

## üîß Customization

### Adding Custom Stages
```python
# Define new stage
TrainingStage.CUSTOM_STAGE = 11

# Create validation criteria
custom_validation = StageValidation(
    success_rate_threshold=0.75,
    min_episodes=20,
    max_episodes=40,
    validation_tasks=["custom_task_1", "custom_task_2"],
    performance_metrics={"custom_metric": 0.8}
)
```

### Modifying Validation Criteria
```python
# Adjust existing stage requirements
validator.stage_validations[TrainingStage.BASIC_CONTROLS].success_rate_threshold = 0.9
validator.stage_validations[TrainingStage.BASIC_CONTROLS].max_episodes = 30
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Optimal Results:
1. **Start from Stage 1**: Don't skip stages - each builds on the previous
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check validation metrics regularly
3. **Adjust Thresholds**: Customize difficulty based on performance
4. **Use Save States**: Start from consistent game positions when needed
5. **Regular Checkpoints**: Save progress frequently during long training

### Common Issues:
- **Stuck in Stage**: Lower success thresholds or increase max episodes
- **Too Easy**: Raise performance requirements for better mastery
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce semantic database size periodically
- **Slow Learning**: Increase LLM interaction frequency

## üìà Expected Results

### Timeline Expectations:
- **Week 1**: Stages 1-3 (Basic competency)
- **Week 2-3**: Stages 4-6 (Core gameplay mastery)
- **Week 4-6**: Stages 7-9 (Advanced skills)
- **Week 7-8**: Stage 10 (Game completion mastery)

### Performance Improvements:

- **Stage 5**: Consistent area exploration
- **Stage 8**: First gym completion
- **Stage 10**: Full game completion capability

## üî¨ Technical Details

### How Learning Works:
1. **LLM Decision Making**: Uses pre-trained Llama 3.2:3b for reasoning
2. **Semantic Memory**: Builds database of successful strategies
3. **Context Enrichment**: Provides stage-specific guidance to LLM
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Each stage introduces new challenges
5. **Mastery Validation**: Ensures skills before advancement

### Key Differences from Traditional RL:
- **No neural network training** - uses pre-trained LLM
- **Experience databases** instead of gradient updates
- **Semantic understanding** rather than pattern recognition
- **Interpretable decisions** with clear reasoning
- **Rapid adaptation** to new game situations

2. Run the interactive setup: `python start_curriculum_training.py`
3. Follow the prompts to configure your training session
4. Watch as your agent progresses through the 10-stage curriculum
5. Monitor progress and adjust settings as needed

The curriculum training system transforms Pokemon Crystal RL from random exploration into systematic skill acquisition, ensuring your agent masters each aspect of the game before moving to more complex challenges!
