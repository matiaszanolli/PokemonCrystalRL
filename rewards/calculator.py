Pokemon Crystal RL Reward Calculator

This module provides the component-based reward calculator implementation for
Pokemon Crystal RL training. The calculator composes multiple reward components
to evaluate game progress and provide appropriate reinforcement signals.

Features:
- Modular reward component system
- Comprehensive state validation
- Anti-farming and anti-glitch protection
- Screen state awareness
- Action-specific reward adjustments

The reward calculator implements the RewardCalculatorInterface and orchestrates
multiple reward components, each handling specific aspects of reward calculation.
