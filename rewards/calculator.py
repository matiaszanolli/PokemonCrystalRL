Pokemon Crystal RL Reward Calculator

Sophisticated reward calculation for Pokemon Crystal RL training, including:
- Exploration rewards and progression tracking
- Battle performance evaluation
- Health and level progression rewards
- Badge milestone rewards
- Anti-farming and anti-glitch protection
- Movement and dialogue interaction rewards

This module provides comprehensive reward calculation functionality for training
reinforcement learning agents to play Pokemon Crystal effectively.
